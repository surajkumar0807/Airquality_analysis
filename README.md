# Air Quality Analysis and Prediction ML Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict air quality using machine learning techniques. It utilizes historical air quality data to train predictive models, which can then be used to forecast air quality levels in the future. Additionally, the project provides insights into the factors influencing air quality and visualizations to enhance understanding.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess raw air quality data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to gain insights into air quality trends, patterns, and correlations.
- Machine Learning Models: Train machine learning models to predict air quality based on various factors such as weather conditions, geographical location, and pollutant levels.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assess the performance of the predictive models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.
- Visualization: Visualize air quality trends, model predictions, and feature importance to facilitate interpretation and decision-making.
